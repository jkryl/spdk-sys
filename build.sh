# This is a script which automates building of spdk fat library containing all
# spdk, dpdk and isa-l object files. It would have been nice if this was part
# of spdk makefiles so that anyone could run just configure && make to get the
# fat lib. But it's not a hot candidate for upstreaming since we do this only
# to work around limitations of rust build system, which is not a good reason
# for changing spdk makefiles.
#
# Usage: ./build.sh [extra-spdk-configure-args...]
#  (i.e. ./build.sh --enable-debug)

# We need to disable some CPU specific optimization flags because we cannot
# know which flavour of x86-64 cpu the binary will run on.
# corei7 with certain cpu flags disabled seems to be a reasonable compromise.

# *should* not be needed to specify the -nmno-xxx however for certain
# it does. There are some existing bugs out there where either
# or gcc do not fully do the right thing, general consensus is that
# you are "tuning" CPU flags, you know what you are doing so these issues
# not treated with high priority.
#
# Ideally, we would use -march=x86-64, however DPDK *requires* at least
#.1 corei7 is the first CPU family that supports this.
#
# The current supported CPU extensions we use are:
#
# MODE64 (call)
# CMOV (cmovae)
# AVX (vmovdqa)
# NOVLX (vmovntdq)
# SSE1 (sfence)
# SSE2 (pause)
# SSSE3 (palignr)
# PCLMUL (pclmulqdq)
# SSE41 (pblendvb)
#
# To see the flags enabled per -march=$arg, you can run:
#
#  gcc -Q -march=corei7 --help=target
#
#  It will show the information in a human readable format, to show the
#  preprocessor output:
#
#  gcc -E -dM -march=corei7 - < /dev/null
#
# note that neither the CPU extensions nor the GCC defines, will map directly
# to a CPU instruction, for this one really needs to read the manual
